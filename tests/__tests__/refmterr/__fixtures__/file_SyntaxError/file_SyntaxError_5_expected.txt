 ERROR  tests/__tests__/refmterr/__fixtures__/file_SyntaxError/file_SyntaxError_5.ml:4 0-4 

1 ┆ let () = if true then
2 ┆   print_endline "gosh";
3 ┆   print_endline "so much functional purity"
4 ┆ else
5 ┆   print_endline "that I cant even"

This is a syntax error.
Did you happen to have put a semicolon on the line before else? Also, `then` accepts a single expression. If you've put many, wrap them in parentheses.
Note: the location indicated might not be accurate.
